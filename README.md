<h1>DenoBot</h1>
<p>A Discord Bot that uses the newly released Deno Runtime with the Discordeno Library.</p>

## About
As Deno was just released. I decided to try making a Discord Bot with Typescript. Part of this codebase is based and insprired from [Skillz4Killz Discord Bot Template](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno-bot-template/). Deno supports that out of the box and thats awesome! Well I am kinda experienced at Typescript and trying to improve my skills at it.

Please note that I haven't came up with an offical name for this Bot. For now, its called DenoBot because it uses Deno as the runtime and is a Discord Bot with the Discordeno library.

The bot is not available for invite, sorry. I am going to make it open source for some time as there isn't actually many Deno Bots that use Discordeno. So far, its the best one for Deno at this stage.

## Features
- Simple and easy setup
- Events Folder for the events
- Inhibitors (I call them a **Command Check** kinda) for pre-check requirements on commands.
- Roleplay, Moderation, Search commands
- Changeable settings like the Prefix
- Fast! (Compared to my other bots)

## How to host this?
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/ntm-development/DenoBot`
2. Create your `configs.ts` file with the following details: *(Example `configs.js` File available.)*
    - TOKEN *(Don't show anyone this! I mean ANYONE!)*
    - botID
    - prefix
3. Make sure you install the dependecies with `deno run "deno.land link"`, if not. Install Deno and VS Extensions.
4. Start up with `deno run --allow-read --allow-net --unstable  mod.ts`
5. You should have a online and functioning Discord Bot!
